# Iris Flower Classification Project

## Overview
This repository contains a machine learning project implemented in a Jupyter Notebook to classify Iris flower species (Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica) using Logistic Regression. The project utilizes the classic Iris dataset, featuring data preprocessing, model training, and prediction capabilities with scikit-learn.

## Features
- Data loading and exploration using pandas and matplotlib.
- Training a Logistic Regression model with scikit-learn.
- Model evaluation with accuracy scoring.
- Prediction of Iris species based on sepal and petal measurements.
- Export functionality using joblib (in progress).

## Requirements
- Python 3.10.0
- Libraries:
  - numpy
  - pandas
  - matplotlib
  - scikit-learn
  - joblib

Install dependencies using:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn joblib
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory and open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   cd repository-name
   jupyter notebook iris-flowers-class-prediction.ipynb
   ```
3. Run the cells to load the data, train the model, and make predictions.

## Dataset
The project uses the Iris dataset, which includes 150 samples with 4 features:
- Sepal Length (cm)
- Sepal Width (cm)
- Petal Length (cm)
- Petal Width (cm)
and a target variable with 3 species classes.

## Results
- The model achieves an accuracy of approximately 96.67% on the test set.
- Example prediction: For input `[1.3, 3.3, 4.1, 3.1]`, the model predicts species 2 (Virginica).

## Files
- `iris-flowers-class-prediction.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the project code.

## Future Improvements
- Complete the joblib export functionality for model persistence.
- Add cross-validation to improve model robustness.
- Include visualization of decision boundaries.
